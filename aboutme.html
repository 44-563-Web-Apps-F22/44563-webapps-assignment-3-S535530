            I am a Senior here at Northwest. 
            I play the Trombone for the marching band and have been since I came here to Northwest. 
            I have been playing Trombone since 5th grade. I have been doing marching band since High School.

        <h4>Star Wars Episode 5 Empire Strikes Back</h4>
        <p>
            I like Empire Strikes Back(ESB) because it continues where A New Hope left off and continues the adventures of Luke Skywalker. 
            We also see more of the Empire when they hunt down the Rebellion following the Battle of Hoth. Also we we get to see more of Darth Vader which is always a plus.
            Finally, we get the beg twist following Luke's and Vader's first duel that will set up the events of Return of the Jedi.
